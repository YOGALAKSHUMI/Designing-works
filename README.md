# Designing Work

LOGO DESIGN:
            A clean and simple design with a focus on typography and geometric shapes. This style uses limited colors, negative space, and sharp lines to convey a contemporary feel. The logo could emphasize bold, sans-serif fonts with subtle visual accent.

PACKAGE DESIGN:
            The process of creating the visual and structural design of a product's packaging. It involves designing the outer wrapping, container, or box that holds and protects the product while also serving as a way to attract and inform potential customers.

SOCIAL MEDIA POST DESIGN:
            The visual and textual elements crafted to create engaging and appealing content for social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. The goal is to grab users' attention quickly and encourage them to interact with the post, whether thatâ€™s through likes, comments, shares, or clicks.

APP DDESIGN:
            Creating the visual and interactive aspects of a mobile or web application. It focuses on how an app looks (User Interface or UI) and how it works (User Experience or UX).
